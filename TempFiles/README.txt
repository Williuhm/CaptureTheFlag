# Introduction

## What is a Computer Science Capture The Flag?

A computer science capture the flag is a game targetted at aspiring
programmers. The game includes multiple intentionally vulnerable
products for users to hack, decrypt, break, or gain access to using
whatever it takes to find the flag.

## What is "the flag"?

The flag is a string of text hidden within each challenge that will
follow a pattern. Every flag starts with the text "sfaCS{" and ends
with "}". Between the braces, there are characters that will make a
phrase or some random values. Speaking of flags, you just found
your first flag for problem0: sfaCS{h0us3_rul3s_XXXXXXXX}

## What to do with the flag?

Once you have the flag, use the python script called 'submit' in
the parent folder with the problem name and the problem's flag.
This command can be found below for a better idea on the usage of
the script.

# Rules

- No cheating. Sharing answers is not allowed and will be noted.

- Don't break the server. Others use it and we can find out who
  caused the issue. We will revoke your access to the problems.
  
- This project is still in development. If there are bugs, errors,
  or any other issues. Report them and don't abuse them. I will
  fix it to the best of my ability. 
  
# Commands

This is a list of important commands and what they do. Refer back
to this list if you get stuck, lost, or forget anything.

- Use 'ls' to list the files in the current directory.

- Use 'cd <PATH>' to change the current directory. Use 'cd ..' to
  go up one folder to the parent folder.
  
- Use 'cat <FILE>' to print the contents of a file to the screen.

- Use (CTRL) + (C) to terminate a process if it's running too long.

- Use 'man <COMMAND>' for more information about a command.

- Use 'logout' to close the terminal and leave your session.

- Use 'python3 ../generateP#.py' to generate a problem with that
  number. Replace the # with the problem you would like to attempt.
  
- Use 'python3 ../submit.py problem# <FLAG>' to submit an attempt
  for a problem. Replace the # with the problem you would like to
  attempt.
